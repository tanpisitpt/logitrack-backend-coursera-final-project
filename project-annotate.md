## Activity 1

**Copilot have helped me with:**

- Generated additional EF Core Data annotations such as, [Key], [Required]
- Generated Joint table for Many-to-Many Relationship between Order and InventoryItem
  - Even though the assignment state one-to-many relationship, I see that it must be Many-to-Many relationship
- Suggest improvement on Order class, AddItem() and RemoveItem() methods.
